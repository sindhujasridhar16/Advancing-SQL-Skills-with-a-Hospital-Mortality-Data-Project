# Advancing-SQL-Skills-with-a-Hospital-Mortality-Prediction-Project

I delved into a fascinating SQL mini-project focusing on predicting in-hospital mortality for admitted patients. Here's a breakdown of my approach and key findings:

- **Business Problem:** Healthcare professionals seek to identify the main causes of in-hospital mortality to develop targeted interventions and evidence-based protocols.
- **Approach:** I obtained the dataset, cleaned it in Excel, imported it to MySQL, and conducted insightful SQL queries. With my SQL skills, I explored patient attributes such as age, ethnicity, gender, weight, BMI, heart rate, and comorbidities. Through the queries, I uncovered patterns, trends, and correlations within the data.
- **Key Findings:** Age emerged as a significant predictor of in-hospital mortality, with nearly 20% mortality among patients aged 70 or older. Comorbidities, particularly diabetes, and abnormal heart rates were also strong predictors. Patients staying for less than a day at the ICU had a better chance of survival.
- **Next Steps/Recommendations:** While the dataset provided valuable insights, it lacked certain factors like specific treatments, socioeconomic variables, and psychosocial factors. Future studies should incorporate these variables for a more comprehensive analysis.
